The Jasmine DDescriber is an idea plug-in to simplify unit testing in Jasmine (http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).

With the plugin you can quickly change a describe() into a ddescribe() and an it() into an iit() to make your test
runner, such as Testacular or JSTD, run a specific set of suites (describe()) and unit tests (it()).

It contains two components: a dialog and a tool window.

You can launch the dialog by pressing Ctrl SHIFT D (Command Shift D on a mac). The dialog has the following features:

Change a single describe() or it() by hitting Enter or clicking on the OK button.
Double-click to jump to a specific describe() or it().
Start typing to search.
Clean all the ddescribe()'s and iit()'s with one button.
Select multiple items and click OK to change many elements at a time.

The tool window has the following features:

See which files have an iit() or a ddescribe() in the project.
Clean all the files.
Double click to jump to the location of an it() or describe().
Filter to show only the elements marked for run.
It automatically updates when you use the dialog.
Refresh to update when you make changes manually.
